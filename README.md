# you-are-here-part-1

This is the code for the long form generative art project You Are Here (Part 1) by Truedrew.

This project is on the Prohibition platform, so some of the code is Prohibition-specific.

In general, you can go back to any point in the project's history and run the index.html file to see the art at that point in time. Depending on the state of the code at any given commit, you may need to tweak the token hash to see the art.

Unfortunately, none of the commits have detailed labeling or descriptions about what was changed. Maybe next time.

I'm @truedrewco on Twitter if you have any questions. ü§ù
